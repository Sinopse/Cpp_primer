Friends are useful when we have nonmember functions which are denied
acces to the members of the class since they are not public. The pros
are that the data is more encapsulated and protected from user
intrusion but on the other hand friends make syntax and code unwieldy
introducing declaration of friends inside of the class, whereas they are normally
declared and defined outside it.
