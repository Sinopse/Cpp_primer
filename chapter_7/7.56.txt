static members are members that exist outside any object and are
associated with a class.

One of the advantages is that class instances can share static members
between ecah other, in other words, they all have access to them.

You do not need a constructor to initialize them.

A static member definition may access the private members of its
class.

static members can have incomplete types.

static members can be used as default arguments
