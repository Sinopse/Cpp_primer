// I don't think that the Sales_data constructor should be explicit
// because otherwise we won't be able to perform conversion from string
// to Sales_data object, which in this case might be desired

// the beneifits is that we are in control of how we initialize our objects
// at the same tiime it gives us restricted control in case where we desir to
// create an object

// you can only perform explicit on constructors with single arguments
