a) the first call is illegal because no arguments are supplied annd
the firsst argument must be supplied

b) legal call, likely to match the programmer's intent, becuase

c) is legal but won't match expectations because the first passed
argument will initialize the first parameter, ans the second one is
default and will be converted to its decimal representation
