a) the second call must be supplied with two const reference to
int. The compiler will decide which function to call based on the
constness of the arguments supplied

b) the aboce said applies here as well

c) this call is ambiguos because we are dealing in the second
decalration with top-level constants. Top-level constants are
discraded in function matching and thus the two calls are identical
resulting in a conversion from a pointer to char to int
